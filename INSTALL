How To Install
--------------

There are two ways to install pyifbabel. If you are familiar with the
installation of Python modules, there is the usual `setup.py'
script. Simply run:

    $ python setup.py install

If, on the other hand, you prefer the classic GNU style of
installation, you will find a standard `configure' script and a
`Makefile.in'. You may simply do the following:

    $ ./configure
    $ make install

Both methods allow you to install to a non-standard location by
passing the `--prefix' argument:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr
    $ make install

The GNU method also provides you with the option of installing to a
virtualenv. Simply pass `--with-virtualenv' to the `configure' script
and set `--prefix' to the location of the virtualenv:

    $ ./configure --with-virtualenv --prefix=/home/monty/venv
