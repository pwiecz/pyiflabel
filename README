# pyifbabel

This is a Python implementation of the Treaty of Babel
(http://babel.ifarchive.org/), a unified method for identifying
interactive fiction ("text adventure") story files.

This module was originally written by Per Liedman and, later, Brandon
Invergo, for Grotesque, an Interactive Fiction library manager
(http://grotesque.invergo.net).  While much of the module was written
from scratch, many parts were liberally adapted from the C source of
the official `babel' software provided on the Treaty website.  For
that, much indebtedness goes to L. Ross Raszewski for writing the
original code and to all the developers of the game formats for
helping him decode all that binary data.

# Testing

If you've downloaded the source and you are interested in running the
unit tests, note that in order to run these tests, you must provide
your own story files.

# Upcoming

* verify/lint ifiction files
* blorb files
* Python 3 support
